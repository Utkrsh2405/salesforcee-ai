## Full Project To-Do List: Dual-API AI Chatbot
Phase 0: üöÄ Project Setup & Foundation
[ ] Initialize React Project: Use Vite for a fast, modern setup.

Bash

npm create vite@latest your-chatbot-app -- --template react
cd your-chatbot-app
[ ] Setup Git Repository: Initialize git, create a repository on GitHub, and make your first commit.

[ ] Plan Component Structure: Quickly sketch out the components you'll need: Layout, ChatContainer, MessageList, MessageBubble, InputBar, Login, SignUp, Header.

[ ] Gather All Credentials:

Create a Firebase project and get your firebaseConfig object.

Get your API key from the Google AI Studio for the Gemini API.

Get your API key from OpenRouter.

Phase 1: üèóÔ∏è Core Chatbot Functionality (MVP)
[ ] Build the Static Chat UI: Create the React components for the chat interface. Use dummy data (an array of message objects) to build the visuals without any backend logic.

[ ] Create Serverless Functions:

Create the /api directory.

Inside, create gemini.js and openrouter.js.

Write the Node.js code in each file to accept a message and call the respective AI service.

[ ] Secure API Keys Locally: Create a .env file in your project root and add your keys (GEMINI_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY). Make sure .env is in your .gitignore file.

[ ] Connect UI to a Single API: Make your React app's input bar functional. On send, make a fetch call to one of your endpoints (e.g., /api/gemini) and display the response.

[ ] Implement Dual-API Logic:

Add a state variable in your React component to track the selected AI provider ('gemini' or 'openrouter').

Add a simple dropdown or toggle switch in the UI to change this state.

Modify the fetch call to dynamically use the correct endpoint based on the selected provider.

Phase 2: üîê User Authentication with Firebase
[ ] Setup Firebase Project: In the Firebase Console, enable "Email/Password" and optionally "Google" as sign-in providers.

[ ] Integrate Firebase SDK:

npm install firebase

Create the src/firebase.js file and initialize the app with your firebaseConfig.

[ ] Create Authentication UI: Build the Login.jsx and SignUp.jsx components with email/password forms.

[ ] Implement Auth Logic: Wire up the forms to the Firebase SDK functions: createUserWithEmailAndPassword, signInWithEmailAndPassword, and signOut.

[ ] Manage Global Auth State: In your main App.jsx, use the onAuthStateChanged listener to track the currentUser. This is the most important step for knowing if a user is logged in.

Phase 3: üé® Integration & Refinement
[ ] Protect Chatbot Route: Use the currentUser state from Phase 2 to control what the user sees.

If currentUser exists: Show the ChatContainer component.

If currentUser is null: Show the Login/SignUp page.

[ ] Refine UI/UX:

Add loading indicators while waiting for AI responses.

Display clear error messages for API failures or failed logins.

Ensure the chat window automatically scrolls to the latest message.

Check for mobile responsiveness.

[ ] (Optional) Add Social Login: Implement "Sign in with Google" using Firebase for a better user experience. It's surprisingly easy once you have the base setup.

[ ] (Optional) Persist Chat History: Use localStorage to save and load the chat history for a user, so it doesn‚Äôt disappear on page refresh.

Phase 4: üìö Documentation & Deployment
[ ] Complete the README.md: Fill out the to-do list you created earlier. Add a final screenshot, describe the project structure, and ensure the setup instructions are clear.

[ ] Prepare for Deployment:

Run npm run build to ensure the project builds without errors.

Clean up any console logs or unused code.

[ ] Deploy to Vercel or Netlify: Connect your GitHub repository to your chosen hosting provider for easy, continuous deployment.

[ ] Configure Production Environment Variables: This is critical. In your Vercel/Netlify project settings, add the GEMINI_API_KEY and OPENROUTER_API_KEY as environment variables. The live site will not work without this.

[ ] Final Testing: Thoroughly test the deployed application. Create a new account, log in, test both AI models, and log out.
